      <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Solution</h2>
      <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Encryptix offers a sophisticated interface that allows hospitals and medical institutes to encrypt their datasets and perform classNameification queries using k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms. {"Here's"} how we achieve this:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">
        <li>
          <strong>Data Encryption</strong>: All medical datasets are encrypted using partial homomorphic encryption before leaving your premises. This ensures that sensitive information remains protected throughout the process.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Secure Cloud Processing</strong>: Encrypted data is processed by two non-colluding cloud servers. These servers perform the necessary calculations on the encrypted data without decrypting it, maintaining the utmost level of security.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>classNameification Queries</strong>: Users can run KNN classNameification queries on the encrypted datasets. Our advanced algorithms handle these queries in the cloud, delivering accurate and secure results.
        </li>
      </ul>
